    "## Introduction and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "During the late 18th century and early 19th century, authors in the United States possessed the same literary heritage that writers in Great Britain did (Herschel Parker, in Norton Anothology of American Literature). Hence, American literature was influenced by European notions and parallel developments. After the war of 1812, there was an increasing desire to produce uniquely American literature and culture. However, American writers were not achieving the originality and uniqueness in their work to distinguish it from European literature. For example, Edward Fiorelli highlights the influence of the early works of John Neal in developing American style of literature: \"He criticised Irving and Cooper for relying on old British conventions of authorship to frame American phenomena.\" Howard Mumford Jones talks more about the influence of European ideas in 19th century America (Howard Mumford Jones, 1935).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, Herschel Parker indicated that writers and readers in America started sensing elusive quality about its new American literature in the 1850s. The literature consists of topics including but not limited to \"trauma of rapid change\", \"repeated physical uprootings\", \"making a success of failure\", and \"power of human beings to destroy nature\". In the following analyses, we will test the following hypothesis by comparing and contrasting the text of American fiction before and after 1850: **American literature started to become unique and original after 1850 unlike the novels inspired by Europeans in previous years**. The objective of the study is to find if there is a significant difference between American fiction before and after 1850. The results can act as supporting evidence to Herschel Parker's claim about the change in American literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Corpus and Data\n",
    "The corpus used includes 1,540 volumes representing 40% of the American fiction from 1789 to 1875. The data is sufficient to analyze any deviation in literature in the works of authors before and after 1850. The metadata were collected manually by a team of undergraduate students at the University of Notre Dame. The following portion of code provides some relevant descriptive statistics of the corpus."

    "The corpus is not completely ideal for the purpose of testing our hypothesis because all of the novels in the corpus are American. It would be interesting to compare American literature to English or German literature before and after 1850 to better analyze whether European literature's influence on American literature was decreasing over the years. Nevertheless, the corpus provided should be sufficient to check whether the change in American literature in the 19th century was significant. \n",

    "Even though quantitative distances of textual data is not a state-of-the-art method to draw conclusions, the results do indicate a difference between the two sets of corpuses. We can see that the two sets of novels have a higher cosine and euclidean distances between each other as compared to the distance among their group of novels. The average euclidean and cosine distance between novels before 1850 and after 1850 can be increased by tweaking the parameteres, using different vectorizing or tokenization methods. However, methods used later in the analysis are more representative of the hypothesis being tested which is where such optimization methods are used. Nevertheless, the findings are not comprehensive enough to test the hypothesis completely, but do suggest a disparity between the novels published before 1850 and after 1850. Therefore, we can proceed with further analysis with this indication in mind. "

    "Herschel Parker gives a couple of examples of famous writers who showed significant indication of unique American literature during the 1850s. For example, Herschel Parker quoutes, \"In Melville's Moby-Dick was a sense of grandeur of the physical universe and man's role in it long suppressed in European consciousness.\" Melville was one of the examples that Herschel Parker gave when he recognized the change in American Literature in the 1850s. The following analysis focuses on whether if Melville's work changed as claimed by Herschel Parker."

    "The distances between the novels published by Melville Herman before and after 1850 are evident. This difference is seen more in the cosine distances where the cosine distances are as low as 0.45 among novels before 1850s. The distance between the novels before and after 1850 are not much highlighted in this analysis except for his publication in 1857 vs 1849 (cosine distance of 0.94). The publication in 1855 vs 1849 seemed the most far apart in vector space. This is one of the reasons why we do not place much importance on vector space distances as aforementioned in the previous results. "

    "In this portion of the analysis, we will discuss why unsupervised machine learning methods are not appropriate for this analysis. Firstly, we have the labels for the publication dates to construct a supervised learning method (next part). Secondly, it would be difficult to evaluate the outcomes. For example, we construct hard clusters with 2 labels with the anticipation that the model will divide the data into clusters of before and after 1850. We cannot evaluate the labels without using the actual publication years of the novels which undermines the whole purpose of using an unsupervised model. It would have been easier to evaluate the results if we were aware of certain token features that are highly represented in unique American literature after the 1850s. But we do not have that information or at least are not that certain about such information. Therefore, it is better to proceed with supervised learning methods."

    "Using supervised learning methods, we aim to predict the publication date to check if the textual information in the novels is enough for different machine learning models and/or classification methods to predict years correctly. This would be an indication that the text of these novels can be used as features to identify which ones belonged in the era where American literature was inspired by Europeans and which ones belong in the era where American authors were incorporating uniqueness and originality in their writings. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first run a standard token-based and word embedding-based classification using Logistic Regression because the output we are looking for is binary. Thereafter, we will attempt to fine-tune through different parameters and classification methods to improve evaluation scores of our results. The reason for tuning the models is to achieve the best possible result for the corpus and open opportunities for future studies. We use grid search to find the optimum parameters for functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the reason why we believe supervised learning methods are the best to test the hypothesis that American literature changed after 1850 is because we are not that aware of the features that represent this change but we have desired outcome labels which we can use to train classifiers. Doing so will help us test the hypothesis and evaluate using different scoring methods by cross validation. "

    "We did attempt to use more sophisticated supervised learning models which included a word embedding-based classification as well as a Multi Layer Perceptron. However, because of the computational limitations, we were not able to make the best out of these models when analyzing American literature in the 19th century. Nevertheless, it does not undermine the results we got from our token-based classification methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before giving our final conclusion, it is important to indicate the limitations faced in this analysis. Firstly, it was difficult to determine what made American literature unique in the 1850s. There were indications of sub-topics and idealogies that started to get introduced in the 1850s, but it was difficult to discover the features that would represent those sub-topics and/or ideologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the corpus provided consisted only of American literature. Based on the discussion at the beginning of the analysis, before the 1850s most of American literature was inspired by European literature. The analysis could have been more comprehensive and accurate if we had sufficient enough textual data of the European novels during that era. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the large sizes of the novels during that period limited us from using word embedding adequetly. Even though we did get significant enough results to come to a conclusion, it would have been interesting to see other supervised learning methods performed using word-embeddings rather than tokens as it is quite understandable that embeddings would incorporate the context of the text."

    "To summarize the conclusion we draw from our findings, we believe that there was a significant difference between the novels before and after 1850 which most certainly supports the fact that authors in American began to incorporate uniqueness and originality in their writings after 1850, unlike before."
