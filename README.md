# American-Literature
American literature started to become unique and original after 1850 unlike the novels inspired by Europeans in previous years. The objective of the study is to find if there is a significant difference between American fiction before and after 1850. The results can act as supporting evidence to Herschel Parker's claim about the change in American literature.
